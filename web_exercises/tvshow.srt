00:00:01,406 --> 00:00:03,220
Previously on "Resurrection"...

2
00:00:03,274 --> 00:00:04,219
What did you do?

3
00:00:04,245 --> 00:00:08,456
Did you honestly think I'd hurt my own
grandson? I tried to protect you.

4
00:00:08,478 --> 00:00:10,145
No wonder you both hate me,

5
00:00:10,179 --> 00:00:14,116
because deep down, I've
always hated both of you.

6
00:00:14,283 --> 00:00:16,425
At least you're finally
telling the truth.

7
00:00:16,657 --> 00:00:17,539
With no one to claim her,

8
00:00:17,565 --> 00:00:19,945
- she'll have to go to the government.
- I don't care.

9
00:00:19,994 --> 00:00:23,815
Are you blaming me? I never
blamed you for Jacob's death!
